# Hun Dao Storage

**Status:** Placeholder (Phase 1)

## Purpose
This package will contain data persistence logic for Hun Dao, including:
- NBT serialization/deserialization
- State persistence
- Save/load operations
- Data migration utilities

## Planned Implementation
To be filled in Phase 2 according to `HunDao_Rearchitecture_Plan.md`.

Phase 2 will implement:
- `HunDaoSoulStateStore` - manages soul state persistence
- NBT migration from current inline storage
- Unified state access through runtime interfaces

## Architecture Alignment
Mirrors `jian_dao/storage/` structure for consistency across weapon systems.
