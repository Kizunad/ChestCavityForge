# Hun Dao Client

**Status:** Placeholder (Phase 3)

## Purpose
This package will contain client-side code for Hun Dao, including:
- Client-side rendering logic
- Client event handlers
- Client-side state management
- Particle and visual effect management

## Phase 3 Status
Phase 3 focused on behavior layer modularization. Client-side code remains in placeholder state.

## Planned Implementation
Client-side features will be implemented in Phase 4+ according to the following priorities:
1. Soul beast transformation visual effects
2. Soul flame particle effects
3. Gui wu (鬼雾) fog rendering
4. HUD overlays for hunpo/soul beast status
5. Client-side state synchronization

## Architecture Alignment
Mirrors `jian_dao/client/` structure for consistency across weapon systems.

## Future Work
- Visual effect managers for soul flame, soul beast aura
- Particle systems for hun-dao abilities
- Client-side event handlers for FX synchronization
- Rendering hooks for custom overlays
